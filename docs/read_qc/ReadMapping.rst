Mapping to reference
--------------------

GraphMap is a novel mapper targeted at aligning long, error-prone third-generation sequencing data.
It is designed to handle Oxford Nanopore MinION 1d and 2d reads with very high sensitivity and accuracy, and also presents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art for PacBio read mappers.
GraphMap was also designed for ease-of-use: the default parameters can handle a wide range of read lengths and error profiles, including: Illumina, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.
