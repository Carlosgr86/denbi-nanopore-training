Assembly Graph inspection with bandage
==================

Bandage is a program for visualising de novo assembly graphs. By displaying connections which are not present in the contigs file, Bandage opens up new possibilities for analysing de novo assemblies.

You can start Bandage with::

  Bandage

and load the following file::

   ~/workdir/assembly/assembly.contigs.gfa

and click on "Draw Graph"
This is the assembly graph of our Nanopore Assembly. Compare it to a graph computed with Illumina data::

   ~/workdir/assembly/assembly.contigs.gfa
